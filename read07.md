# Domain Modeling & Html Table

## Domain Modeling

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.

A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors.

As well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.
  
An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

## Javascript constructor

The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object.

## Document Object Mode

The Document Object Model **DOM** is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.
It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects.
That way, programming languages can connect to the page.

## Html Table

The ```<table>``` tag defines an HTML table.

Each table row is defined with a ```<tr>``` tag. Each table header is defined with a ```<th>``` tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a ```<td>``` tag.

By default, the text in ```<th>``` elements are bold and centered.

By default, the text in ```<td>``` elements are regular and left-aligned.

```<table style="width:100%">```

  ```<tr>```

   ```<th>First Name</th>```

   ```<th>Last Name</th>```

   ```<th>Age</th>```

  ```</tr>```

  ```<tr>```

   ```<td>motasem</td>```

   ```<td>meqbel</td>```

   ```<td>23</td>```

  ```</tr>```

  ```<tr>```

  ```<td>ahmed</td>```

  ```<td>khaled</td>```

   ```<td>64</td>```

  ```</tr>```

```</table>```

# JQuery  , Pair programming

this document contain a brief intro to these topic .

##  JQuery

"jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript."(1)

as describes we can use JQuery to manipulate DOM and other staff easily .

ex : 
	
```$( "button.continue" ).html( "Next Step..." )```

Get the ```<button>``` element with the class ```continue``` and change its HTML to ```Next Step...```

As you can see to manipulate any element in the dom by JQuery we need just to select that element using th $(element) expression
and the call the desired function to it .

Simply ..

## Pair Programming

Pair programming is a form of continual inspection by one team member of the work of a teammate.
Typically, while one programs, the other inspects and devises tests. These roles are reversed for periods of
time that the pair determines.(2)

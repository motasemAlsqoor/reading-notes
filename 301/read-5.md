# Heroku

Heroku is a platform as a service based on a managed container system, with integrated data services and a powerful ecosystem, for deploying and running modern apps. The Heroku developer experience is an app-centric approach for software delivery, integrated with today’s most popular developer tools and workflows(1)

## Heroku Runtime 

Heroku runs your apps inside dynos — smart containers on a reliable, fully managed runtime environment. Developers deploy their code written in Node, Ruby, Java, PHP, Python, Go, Scala, or Clojure to a build system which produces an app that's ready for execution. The system and language stacks are monitored, patched, and upgraded, so it's always ready and up-to-date. The runtime keeps apps running without any manual intervention. (1)

# REST

REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server. We will go into what these terms mean and why they are beneficial characteristics for services on the Web.(1)

## Separation of Client and Server

in the REST architectural style, the implementation of the client and the implementation of the server can be done independently without each knowing about the other(1)

## Statelessness

Systems that follow the REST paradigm are stateless, meaning that the server does not need to know anything about what state the client is in and vice versa. In this way, both the server and the client can understand any message received, even without seeing previous messages. (1)

## Communication between Client and Server

In the REST architecture, clients send requests to retrieve or modify resources, and servers send responses to these requests. Letâ€™s take a look at the standard ways to make requests and send responses.(1)

# Css Layout

Websites often display content in multiple columns (like a magazine or a newspaper)

HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page

There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:

CSS framework
CSS float property
CSS flexbox
CSS grid

```<div>```

* elements are often used as containing elements
* to group together sections of a page.
* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
* specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
* The float property moves content to the left or right
* of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
* pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page

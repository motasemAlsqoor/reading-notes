# Html Links and layout

## Html links

Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.

HTML links are hyperlinks.

You can click on a link and jump to another document.

When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand

```<p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>```

## Html layout

Websites often display content in multiple columns (like a magazine or a newspaper)

HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page

There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:

CSS framework
CSS float property
CSS flexbox
CSS grid

## JavaScript Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

```function sum(p1, p2) {```

  ```return p1 + p2;```

```}```

Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

## JavaScript Objects

JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.

You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:

```var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};```

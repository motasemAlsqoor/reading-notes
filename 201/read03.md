# HTML : LISTS & BOXES

## Html lists

There are three t XX ypes of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.
XX Ordered lists use numbers.
XX Unordered lists use bullets.
XX Definition lists are used to define terminology.
XX Lists can be nested inside one another

### orderd list

The ordered list is created with
the ```<ol>``` element.

Each item in the list is placed
between an opening ```<li>``` tag
and a closing ```</li>``` tag. (The li
stands for list item.)

```<ol>```

```<li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>```

```<li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20 minutes until tender</li>```

```<li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>```

```<li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>```

```<li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>```

```</ol>```

### unorderd list

The unordered list is created
with the ```<ul>``` element.

Each item in the list is placed
between an opening ```<li>``` tag
and a closing ```</li>``` tag. (The li
stands for list item.)

```<ul>```

```<li>1kg King Edward potatoes</li>```

```<li>100ml milk</li>```

```<li>50g salted butter</li>```

```<li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>```

```<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>```

```</ul>```

### definition list

The definition list is created with
the ```<dl>``` element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
Inside the ```<dl>``` element you will
usually see pairs of ```<dt>``` and
```<dd>``` elements.

```<dt>```
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term).

```<dd>```
This is used to contain the
definition.

```<dl>```

```<dt>Sashimi</dt>```

```<dd>Sliced raw fish that is served with condiments such as shredded daikon radish or ginger root, wasabi and soy sauce</dd>```

```<dt>Scale</dt>```

```<dd>A device used to accurately measure the weight of ingredients</dd>```

```<dd>A technique by which the scales are removed from the skin of a fish</dd>```

```<dt>Scamorze</dt>```

```<dt>Scamorzo</dt>```

```<dd>An Italian cheese usually made from whole cow's milk (although it was traditionally made from buffalo milk)</dd>```

```</dl>```

## Html Boxes

* CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it has its own box.
* You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
* You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
* It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
* Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
* Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
* CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders

## Java-script array 

JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
```var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];```
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.
You access an array element by referring to the index number.
this statement accesses the value of the first element in cars:
```var name = cars[0];```

## JavaScript Switch Statement

The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

```switch(expression) {```

```case x:```

```//code block```

```break;```

```case y:```

```// code block```

```break;```

```default:```

 ```// code block```

```}```

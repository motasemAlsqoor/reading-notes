# Object & DOM

## JavaScript Object Literal

A JavaScript object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.

 Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package.
 
  This minimizes the use of global variables which can cause problems when combining code.

```var person = {  name: 'motasem',  age: 32,};```

## DOM

When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects

* JavaScript can change all the HTML *elements* in the page
* JavaScript can change all the HTML *attributes* in the page
* JavaScript can change all the *CSS styles* in the page
* JavaScript can *remove* existing HTML elements and attributes
* JavaScript can *add* new HTML elements and attributes
* JavaScript can *react* to all existing HTML events in the page
* JavaScript can *create* new HTML events in the page

*The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.*

# The HTML DOM

The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

The HTML elements as objects

* The **properties** of all HTML elements
* The **methods to** access all HTML elements
* The **events** for all HTML elements

In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.

## Html Images

Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.

```<img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli">```

HTML Images Syntax :

The HTML ```<img>``` tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The ```<img>``` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The ```<img>``` tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The ```<img>``` tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image

## HTML Colors

HTML colors are specified with predefined color names, or with RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, or HSLA values.

Example

```<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Hello World</h1>```

```<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Lorem ipsum...</p>```

```<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Ut wisi enim...</p>```

## Html Text 

There are properties to control t XX he choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.

There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed

If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them

You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.

You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.

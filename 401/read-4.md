# Data Modeling

## 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

1. write the test before writing the code let you fully-understand whats the requirement you need to implement

2. reduce the time of debugging

3. quickly identify the errors and problems 

## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

beforeEach() run automatically before the test 

afterEach()  run automatically after the test

## What is one downside of Test Driven Development

if the requirement change you need to change the test .

it is a slow process 

## Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

the main difference is the readability 

classes are more readable becase it act as container to all properities and behavior 
while the constructor is a container just for properities


## why REST? 

REST is much easier than other approaches such as SOAP which keeps developers from having to reinvent the wheel as far as HTTP request operations go. SOAP also requires separate server and client programs.

Since REST is based on standard HTTP operations, it uses verbs with specific meanings such as "get" or "delete" which avoids ambiguity. Resources are assigned individual URIs, adding flexibility.

With REST, information that is produced and consumed is separated from the technologies that facilitate production and consumption. As a result, REST performs well, is highly scalable, simple, and easy to modify and extend. (1)

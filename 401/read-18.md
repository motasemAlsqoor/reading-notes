# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

Many Serverless applications use Amazon API Gateway, which conveniently replaces the API servers with a managed serverless solution.
